    <h2>Reading</h2>

    <p>I like many things about the United States. It is a big country with many places to visit. People can find big cities, quiet small towns, long beaches, and tall mountains. Every place is a little different. I want to tell you some of the things I love: the cities, the nature, the food, the music, and the people.</p>

    <h2>1. Cities and famous places</h2>
    <p>In the United States there are many famous cities. Cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles are busy and full of life. You can see tall buildings, museums, and big parks. There are also many landmarks. A landmark is a place that many people know. For example, a tall statue, an old building, or a long bridge can be a landmark.</p>

    <p>I enjoy walking in cities because there is always something to do. You can visit a museum in the morning and eat in a small restaurant in the afternoon. In many cities there are street markets. Local people sell food, art, and crafts. It is a good way to meet local people and try new food.</p>

    <h2>2. Nature and national parks</h2>
    <p>The nature in the United States is beautiful and big. There are many national parks. A national park is a large natural area that people protect. You can walk, cycle, or camp in a national park. I like to see mountains, rivers, and forests. Some parks have big rocks or tall trees. Others have lakes with clear water.</p>

    <p>One of the best things is a road trip. A road trip is a long trip by car. You can drive from a city to a national park and see different places. On the road you can stop in small towns and meet friendly people. In the morning you can see the sunrise on the road, and in the evening you can watch the sunset in a quiet place.</p>

    <h2>3. Food and local tastes</h2>
    <p>Food in the United States is very diverse. This means there are many kinds of food. You can find food from many countries. In one city you can eat Mexican food, Italian food, Chinese food, and food from many more places. I like to try local dishes. Local food is food from the area. When I travel, I look for small restaurants and street food. The food is often simple, tasty, and quick to eat.</p>

    <p>I enjoy festivals that sell local food. At festivals you can try sweet and salty snacks, and sometimes you can watch people dance or play music. Sharing food in the street is a nice and fun experience.</p>

    <h2>4. Music, festivals and traditions</h2>
    <p>Music is very important. There are many music styles, like rock, jazz, country, and hip hop. Each style has a story and a place. Cities and towns have festivals with music and dances. A festival is a big party with music, food, and people. At festivals, families, friends, and tourists meet and have fun.</p>

    <p>There are also many traditions. For example, on some days people meet with family and eat special food. People celebrate with colors, music, and lights. Traditions can be different in each region, and this is one reason the country is interesting.</p>

    <h2>5. Friendly people and many cultures</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite things is the people. The United States has people from many countries. This makes the culture rich and diverse. When many people live together, you see many languages, clothes, and celebrations. People are often friendly and open to visitors. They like to talk and share stories.</p>

    <p>Meeting people from different places helps me learn new words and new ideas. I can hear languages and try new foods. This is a simple way to grow and to feel curious about the world.</p>

    <h2>6. Small things I like</h2>
    <p>I also like small things: wide roads, big parks, and comfortable coffee shops. I like quiet mornings in a small town and busy nights in a big city. I like libraries where people read and study. I like local markets where farmers sell fresh fruit and vegetables. These small things make a trip special.</p>

    <h2>7. A place to learn and try</h2>
    <p>The United States is a place to try new things. You can study, work, or travel. You can learn from people and from the land. Every trip helps you understand another culture. For me, travel is a way to learn and to grow.</p>
